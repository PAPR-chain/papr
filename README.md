# Practical Decentralized Open Scientific Publishing on the LBRY Blockchain

Scientific publishing is of immense importance to the progress of science and society. At the moment, it is mainly controlled by a handful of huge publishers making high profit margins from essentially free manuscripts reviewed by unpaid academics and mostly unpaid editors. The only way this strange situation is possible is because of the history leading up to the development and expansion of the internet, and because of the lack of attractive alternatives. `papr` strives to be this alternative.

We base our publishing system on the [LBRY Protocol](lbry.com), which enables file transfers and association of publications with an author identity (channel), among many other features.

This repository extends the [LBRY SDK](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-sdk) and provides all the required functionnalities related to the LBRY blockchain. The SDK can be run as daemon and then used as JSON-RPC server, exactly like the LBRY SDK. A command line application is also provided for convenience.
